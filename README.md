Tutorial by Jonas Schmedtmann

This was a really great tutorial, as I learned a lot of great tricks, but most importantly I learned about the BEM method.
In contrast to www.travelinghartings.com where I named everything by what object it was. Which made sense to me.
I then realized this would be hell for anyone to pick up the project behind me.

The second most important aspect was me learning how to actually use SCSS. On www.travelinghartings.com I treated it the same exact way as CSS.
I had not one iota of an idea what scss and the multiple folder layout was capable of. I also learned the importance of variables. Why and how to actually use them.

This was a great learning oppurtunity.
